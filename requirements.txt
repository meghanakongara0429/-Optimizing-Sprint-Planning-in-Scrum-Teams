# Note for Contributors:
#
# This file lists Python backend dependencies only (for Flask API, etc.).
#
# Frontend (React) dependencies are managed separately using npm and are listed in the 'package.json' file inside the 'src' directory.
# To install frontend dependencies, navigate to the 'src' folder and run:
#   npm install
#
# Do not add React or JavaScript packages here. Use this file only for Python packages required by the backend.
