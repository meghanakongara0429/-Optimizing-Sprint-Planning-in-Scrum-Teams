# Sprint Planning Project - Detailed Explanation

## Project Overview

This is a **full-stack web application** for Agile sprint planning that combines traditional project management tools with AI-powered predictive analytics. The project helps development teams plan sprints more effectively by using machine learning to predict outcomes and optimize task prioritization.

## What's Been Built So Far

### 🎯 **Core Features Implemented**

#### 1. **Sprint Planner Component** (`src/components/SprintPlanner.js`)
- **Backlog Management**: Add, edit, delete user stories with story points, business value, and urgency levels
- **AI-Powered Sprint Generation**: Automatically creates optimal sprint plans based on team capacity
- **Smart Prioritization**: Uses weighted scoring (business value × urgency ÷ story points) to rank tasks
- **Velocity Tracking**: Records and displays historical sprint velocities for better planning
- **Capacity Planning**: Visual feedback showing if selected tasks fit within sprint capacity
- **Sprint Creation**: Modal interface for creating new sprints with goals, dates, and capacity

#### 2. **Kanban Board** (`src/components/KanbanBoard.js`)
- **Visual Task Management**: Four-column board (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- **Real-time Updates**: Drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between stages
- **Inline Editing**: Edit assignee and story points directly on task cards
- **Status Tracking**: Visual progress monitoring across the development workflow

#### 3. **Daily Standup** (`src/components/DailyStandup.js`)
- **Team Updates**: Structured format for daily standup meetings
- **Progress Tracking**: Record what was done yesterday, planned for today, and blockers
- **Historical Data**: Maintains standup history for retrospective analysis

#### 4. **AI Prediction System** (`api.py` + `model.py`)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms
- **Sprint Outcome Prediction**: Predicts actual points completed based on sprint characteristics
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Uses historical sprint data for accurate predictions
- **API Integration**: Flask backend serving predictions to React frontend

### 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

#### Frontend (React)
- **React 18.x**: Latest stable React version with modern hooks and features
- **Bootstrap 5.3.7**: Professional, responsive UI design
- **React Router**: Single-page application with navigation
- **Local Storage**: Data persistence across browser sessions
- **State Management**: React hooks for component state management

#### Backend (Python)
- **Flask API**: RESTful endpoints for AI predictions
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn and XGBoost for predictive modeling
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing for frontend-backend communication
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for dataset handling and feature engineering

#### Data Flow
```
User Input → React Components → Local Storage → Flask API → ML Models → Predictions → UI Display
```

## Current Project Status

### ✅ **What's Working**
1. **Complete UI**: All major components are functional with professional design
2. **Data Persistence**: Tasks, sprint plans, and velocity history saved locally
3. **AI Integration**: Machine learning models successfully integrated and working
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
5. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on all user actions

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### Sprint Planning Algorithm
```javascript
// AI scoring formula implemented
const urgencyWeight = { High: 2, Medium: 1, Low: 0.5 };
const aiScore = (task) => 
  (task.businessValue * 2 + urgencyWeight[task.urgency] * 3) / task.storyPoints;
```

#### Machine Learning Features
- **Story Points**: Task complexity estimation
- **Business Value**: Priority scoring (1-10 scale)
- **Dependency Count**: Number of blocking tasks
- **Team Capacity**: Available development hours
- **Sprint Velocity**: Historical completion rates
- **Blocked Count**: Number of impediments

#### Data Storage Strategy
- **Local Storage**: For session persistence and offline capability
- **Demo Data**: Pre-populated with sample tasks for immediate testing
- **Export/Import**: Ready for database integration


## How Contributors Can Help

### 🚀 **Immediate Opportunities**

#### 1. **Database Integration**
- Replace local storage with a proper database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Implement user authentication and multi-team support
- Add data backup and recovery features

#### 2. **Enhanced AI Features**
- Improve prediction accuracy with more training data
- Add sprint duration prediction
- Implement risk assessment algorithms
- Create team performance analytics

#### 3. **Advanced UI Features**

- Implement real-time collaboration (WebSocket)
- Create sprint burndown charts
- Add export functionality (PDF, Excel)

#### 4. **Team Collaboration**
- User roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer)
- Team member assignment and workload balancing
- Sprint retrospective tools
- Integration with external tools (Jira, GitHub)

### 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**

#### 1. **Backend Enhancement**
